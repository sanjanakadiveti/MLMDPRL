Sanjana Kadiveti Project 4 Running Instructions

All information can be found here: https://github.com/sanjanakadiveti/MLMDPRL

I use the RL Simulator (jar file in github) to run my two mazes. Small maze is called small, Big maze is called big.

Results and graphs can be found in p4excel
- in my report, two graphs could not fit effectively onto Microsoft Word, so I screenshotted 2 graphs (VI Iterations vs PJOG for both mazes) from the excel file into the word document. These can be found in the excel file.


** note: My Small Maze PI Iterations did not save in excel, but the experiment can be easily performed using my small maze and RL-Sim jar file.
